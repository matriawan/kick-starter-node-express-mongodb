# Introduction
> This **kickstarter** or **boilerplate** accelerates ðŸš€ web development with **Docker Compose**, providing a ready-to-use containerized setup where:  
> - **Node.js** serves as the backend runtime environment,  
> - **Express.js** functions as the web framework for handling requests,  
> - **MongoDB** acts as the database for storing data, and  
> - **Docker** ensures a seamless, isolated, and portable development environment.  

The setup includes predefined configurations and dependencies, allowing developers to quickly start building and deploying applications without worrying about manual environment setup.
